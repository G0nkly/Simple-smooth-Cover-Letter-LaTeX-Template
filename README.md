# Simple-smooth-Cover-Letter-LaTeX-Template

A simple but smooth cover letter template in latex.
For a quick insight you can have a look at ```SAS_Cover_Letter.pdf```

This template is broken down into various sections, where most of the content can be modified by providing the respective variables in ```VARIABLES.tex```.

The most important section containing the application text is ```body.tex```.

Feel free to use and modify the template to your needs :-) !
